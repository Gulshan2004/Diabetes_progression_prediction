# Diabetes_progression_prediction
This project is a beginner-level implementation of Linear Regression using the Diabetes dataset from Scikit-learn. The goal is to predict the progression of diabetes in patients one year after baseline, based on ten medical predictors.

The primary objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with the complete ML workflow, including:

Data preprocessing

Feature scaling

Model training

Performance evaluation

Residual analysis and visualization

Through this project, I have deepened my understanding of how regression models work, how to measure model performance, and how to interpret results using residuals and metrics.

While the dataset and problem are relatively simple, the concepts explored are foundational and will serve as a strong base for building more complex machine learning models in the future.

This project also serves as a template structure for upcoming projects, where the focus will shift toward classification, clustering, and real-world datasets.
